## How to use

### Visualization
[Minimal working example](tutorials/minimal/Visualization.html)

What is it for?
* check that the neural network separates the classes well <br/>
we demonstrate this on 2 tasks: [CIFAR10](tutorials/CIFAR10/Visualization.html) and [casting defects detection](tutorials/casting/Visualization.html)

### Bayesianization
[Minimal working example](tutorials/minimal/Bayesianization.html)

What is it for?
* detect corrupted inputs [notebook](tutorials/casting/Bayesianization_for_adversarial.html)
* pruning [notebook](tutorials/CIFAR10/Bayesianization_for_pruning.html)

### Homology analysis
[Minimal working example](tutorials/minimal/Homologies.html)

What is it for?
* analyze model robustness [notebook](tutorials/CIFAR10/Homologies_analysis.html)
* analyze how informative are model features [notebook](tutorials/CIFAR10/Homologies_analysis.html)
